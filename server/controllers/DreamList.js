I insulted them and in general acted like a mischievous boy.  They took a picture of me, probably to warn the police about me.  When they left, I broke down crying again."

At the end of the pain, I died.  I had the chance to be reincarnated as someone I knew.  I chose the woman in the veil, clothed in dark purple, holding a bouquet.  I chose her and she lifted the veil to reveal a woman so very familiar.  Once it became apparent that I was my own mother, I raised me, knowing she/I would be in pain in my future/past.  I prepared myself the best I could for the pain without revealing my knowledge.  It was horribly lonely, especially when I met my Ingrid and had to let my younger self befriend her and love her.  Finally, in my younger self's seventh year, and my twenty seventh (I became my own mother during my wedding to my father nine years before then), I died for the second time and the river stopped."

I was getting a Hunger Games vibe from when I returned to my living quarters.  I wore a hospital gown and I was very effectively trapped in there; many guards at all the exits, and I was kept drugged and asleep for a lot of the time.  (No clue how I got outside at night.  Perhaps all the guards were partying.)  They were doing tests on me to get me pregnant without a father.  Eventually I got away again and I found myself traveling to my house.  Mr. O’Neal was there and he immediately started yelling at me,and a car chase ensued.  I crashed, and then I woke up."

		text: "So the choir was in London.  We looked at a church and someone said it looked French and I totally proved them wrong.  Anyway, we sang on our way to the stage and a king welcomed us into his castle.  Given that all his furniture and stuff was made of radishes, he was 'his Radishty' and 'the Radish King.'  So Connor and I both had a dream that some king was plotting to take over the world.  Being the geniuses we are, we immediately assumed it was the Radish King, and so we attacked him and put him in a cage thing in his castle close to his bedroom.  He didn't like that and was very confused why we did that, but he didn't allow us to explain before pushing us into the cage...."

		text: "The dream had a video game setting where there were four adults (including me) and a baby and a toddler camping out from demons in this little bunker thing.  If we were still they couldn't see us, and there was something about the bunker where as long as we kept them happy it would be okay.  However the demons started attacking us and we tried to run. Outside of the bunker was a lush landscape of beautiful plants, but all of them were spinning in the way that meant they were demons in disguise.  I was the distraction and I died, but I turned into a gravestone and one of my friends tried to get me back to the bunker to resurrect me.  While I was a gravestone, I found that I could sort of walk/shuffle, once she uprooted me.  And then two demons (they're not quite demons, but I don't really know what to call them) seemed to see  and recreate visually my memories by looking at where I was.  They didn't know it was actually me, they just thought it was some phenomenon that had memories when you looked at it.  Earlier in the dream, I had to feed fish and keep them happy (which seemed like a mini game of some sort).  We had gotten to the bunker from another planet and one of the men had already been there and already knew the language and things."
